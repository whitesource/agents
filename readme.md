[White Source agents][1]
===================

Agents keep your [White Source][2] account up to date automatically.
They send a statement of the current use of open source software in your project to [White Source][2].

This information is used to:
 
 * Create and setup new projects
 * Update existing projects inventories
    * Open requests for newly introduced libraries
    * Cancel requests for removed libraries.

An agent is a plugin for one or more components in your project ecosystem. Build systems, continuous integration servers, etc...

### Getting started
Setup and usage instructions for each agent can be found in the [documentation][1].
We recommend visiting the [service documentation][7] as well.

### Available plugins
At the moment we have plugins for [Maven][3], [Ant][10], [Jenkins][4] and [TeamCity][5].
More plugins will be available soon. 
Meanwhile, if you need a plugin for another system please drop a line to our [support team][6].

### Developers
Agents are clients to the service REST api. You can develop your own agent by implementing such a client.
This project provides two modules for Java based agents:

 * Domain model for information and operations in the api
 * Client implementation of the api
 
More information can be found in the [documentation][1]. 
You can have a look in the [technical information][9] if you didn't find what you need.

### Support
You can always create an issue or tell our [support team][6] what you think.
